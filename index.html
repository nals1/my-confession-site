        <p class="confession">[Hey,
I just want to be straight up with you. I like you, and I have for a while now. I really like your smile and the way you carry yourself, and being around you just feels different in a good way.

I don’t know where this will go, but I didn’t want to keep this to myself anymore. Whatever your answer is, I respect it. I just wanted you to know how I feel.]</p>
